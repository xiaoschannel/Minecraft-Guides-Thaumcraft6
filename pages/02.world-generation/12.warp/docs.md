While working your way through Thaumcraft you will notice that some research has a purple swirl around it. You will also notice that you will be warned that completing a particular research will give you a little bit of warp. 

Warp affects your mind. A little warp is fine and inevitable but over time you may get more and more warp. This can cause strange visions and can also kill you:
