The research for this is very simple and you should have no problem completing this. The Bolt option is a mixture between the Projectiles and the Touch options for Foci. Unlike Projectile, it does not have any options in the Focal Manipulator, but it does have a great range (16).

Combining this with any element allows you to fire bolts of magical energy at your foes!
